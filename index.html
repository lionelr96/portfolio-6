				<h2>What is African American Culture?</h2>

				<p>African-American culture refers to the contributions of African Americans to the
					culture of the
					United States,
					either as part of or distinct from mainstream American culture. The distinct identity many of
					African-American
					culture is rooted in the historical experience of the African-American people, including the Middle
					Passage. The
					culture is both distinct and enormously influential on American and global worldwide culture as a
					whole. </p>
				<br>

				<p>African-American culture is rooted in the blend between the cultures of West and Central Africa and
					the
					Anglo-Celtic culture that has influenced and modified its development in the American South.
					Understanding its
					identity within the culture of the United States, it is, in the anthropological sense, conscious of
					its origins
					as largely a blend of West and Central African cultures. Although slavery greatly restricted the
					ability of
					African-Americans to practice their original cultural traditions, many practices, values and beliefs
					survived,
					and over time have modified and/or blended with European cultures and other cultures such as that of
					Amerindians. African-American identity was established during the slavery period, producing a
					dynamic culture
					that has had and continues to have a profound impact on American culture as a whole, as well as that
					of the
					broader world.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Elaborate rituals and ceremonies were a significant part of African-Americans' ancestral culture.
					Many West
					African societies traditionally believed that spirits dwelled in their surrounding nature. From this
					disposition, they treated their environment with mindful care. They also generally believed that a
					spiritual
					life source existed after death and that ancestors in this spiritual realm could then mediate
					between the
					supreme Creator and the living. Honor and prayer were displayed to these "ancient ones", the spirit
					of that
					past. West Africans also believed in spiritual possession.</p>
